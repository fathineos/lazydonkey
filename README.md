# What is lazydonkey
Lazy Donkey is a static music blog with personal album picks.

I wanted to create a simple but "useful" website with an early web
approach which uses hyperlinks to external content.
The focus is on the content with minimal design that helped me explore
the front end technology stack.

Accessibility of the website was taken into consideration by making all
hyperlinks accessible through keyboard.

Developed with HTML / CSS and Vuejs framework.
